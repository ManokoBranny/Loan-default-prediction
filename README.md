# Manoko-loan-default-prediction

# Overview
The Loan Default Prediction project is a supervised machine learning project designed to predict whether a client is likely to default on their loan based on various input features. The app uses machine learning models to make predictions and provides insights into the risk assessment process.

# Features
- Predicts loan default probability for a given client.
- Allows users to input client information, such as loan amount, total due, term days, etc.
- Provides model selection for prediction using various machine learning algorithms.
- Displays user-friendly and visually appealing output.

# Installation
- Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-default-prediction.git
- Navigate to the project directory: cd loan-default-prediction
- Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt

# Models Included
The Loan Default Prediction App currently includes the following machine learning models:

- LinearSVC
- RandomForestClassifier
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- SVC
- LogisticRegression
- KNeighborsClassifier
- GradientBoostingClassifier

# Credits
The Loan Default Prediction App was developed by Manoko Langa.
